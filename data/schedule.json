I’ve counted more than 15 interaction options in total!</p><p>Let’s zoom out and have a look at the general principles rather than going into implementation of specific features. In this talk we are going to structure ways of information sharing across your app and discuss the underlying design patterns.</p><p>Being able to chose how you organise your data flows allows you to adjust the implementation to your use case. We will explore some examples where you can vary the degree of flexibility depending on the way you structure your components and services. However, with great flexibility comes great responsibility. So we will also touch upon the strengths and weaknesses of each data sharing approach.</p>",
